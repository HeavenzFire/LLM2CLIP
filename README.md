# LLM2CLIP: Unlocking Richer Visual Representations with a Powerful Language Model

Welcome to the official repository for **LLM2CLIP**! This project leverages large language models (LLMs) as powerful textual teachers for CLIP's visual encoder, enabling more nuanced and comprehensive multimodal learning.

## Challenges with Existing CLIP

Current versions of CLIP face several limitations:

- **Limited Context Window**: The text encoder has a short context window of only 77 tokens, which restricts its understanding of lengthy inputs.
- **Weak Text Comprehension**: The text encoder is relatively limited in its ability to comprehend complex text, often functioning as a bag-of-words model with limited depth.

## Why Integrate LLM with CLIP?

LLM2CLIP brings the unimaginable power of large language models to CLIP, even surpassing native language capabilities. Our LLM2CLIP, fine-tuned purely on an English corpus, outperforms standard Chinese CLIP models:

1. **Extended Input Window**: The LLM expands CLIP's input window, allowing richer textual context and better comprehension of long inputs.
2. **Enhanced Understanding**: With LLM's help, CLIP gains a deeper understanding of dense, complex captions, leading to improved text-image alignment.
3. **Open-World Knowledge**: The LLM provides open-world knowledge, enabling more globally informed multimodal feature alignment and boosting training efficiency.

## Key Challenges

While LLMs have strong inherent text encoding capabilities, the output space is often not highly separable, which limits their effectiveness for contrastive learning.

## Our Approach

To overcome these challenges, we designed a **Caption-to-Caption Contrastive Learning** strategy. We trained the LLM to better differentiate between captions of the same or different images, enhancing the separability of the LLM's output space. During training, the LLM gradients were frozen while CLIP's visual encoder was fine-tuned on limited data, resulting in significant performance gains. 

Through this strategy, we better utilized the LLM's power to comprehend and process **long and dense captions**, improving the overall representation capabilities.

## What Can You Achieve with LLM2CLIP?

1. **Enhanced CLIP Models**: Fine-tune pretrained CLIP models with dense captions or task-specific image-text datasets, making CLIP stronger for various use cases.
2. **Out-of-the-Box Power**: Directly use our enhanced CLIP models, significantly upgraded with LLM guidance for superior performance in multimodal tasks.
